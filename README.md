# Decentralized DNS Frontend

## Summary
The Decentralized DNS frontend is a work-in-progress application aimed at interacting with the DecentralizedDNS smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionality for registering domain names and resolving domain addresses using a decentralized approach.

### Components
- **DomainRegister**: Allows users to register domain names with associated resolver addresses.
- **DomainResolve**: Enables users to resolve domain names to their associated resolver addresses.

### State Management
The frontend uses Recoil for state management, with atoms defined for storing the web3 instance and contract state.

### App Configuration
- **App.js**: Manages the overall application flow, including wallet connection and rendering of components.

## Note
The development of the Decentralized DNS frontend is ongoing. Further enhancements, UI improvements, and integration with smart contracts are in progress.
